🔍 Excited to share QuickBite, a smart canteen solution developed by a team of three, designed to streamline food ordering and enable seamless, cashless payments in cafeteria environments.

💼 My core contributions included:

🛠️ Database Architecture: Designed and implemented a relational database using Supabase to manage menus, users, orders, and transactions — with a focus on scalability, integrity, and real-time performance.

🌐 Admin Web Application: Developed a responsive web dashboard using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node.js + Express) for administrators to manage menu items, track orders, and configure system settings.

💳 RFID-Based Payment Integration: Created Python scripts to interface with RFID readers and LCD displays, enabling fast, secure, and user-friendly wallet-based payments.

💰 Online Recharge System: Integrated Razorpay to allow users to top up their digital wallets conveniently through a secure online portal.

🔧 Technologies used: Supabase | Node.js | Express | Python | Razorpay | RFID | HTML/CSS/JS

This project reflects my experience in full-stack development, database design, and hardware-software integration, delivering a robust, user-centric fintech application.
